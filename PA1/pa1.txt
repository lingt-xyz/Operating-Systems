Task#1
  
	Explanation:
    
		Content switch could happen between deposit() and withdraw(). Consequently it may cause overwriting the value of balance in the register.
  
	Modify Y=20:
    
		The results would not be affected. Because content switch happens between deposit() and withdraw().
    
		The equivalent situation in operating system is that a printer is in use but another request has been made to performe a printing task.

Task#2
  
	Start order of threads:
    
		The system determines the start order of the threads.
  
	Life cycle of a thread:
    
		A thread would first be created.
    
		By being invoked it would be put in the ready queue.
    
		When the system has scheduled this thread, and it is dispatch by the scheduler, the thread would be running.
    
		If the thread is interrupted, it would be back to the ready queue.
    
		If the thread requires I/O or other system calls that has to been done before it can continue executing, it would go to waiting state.
    
		After the I/O is done or the system calls have completed, the thread would be back to the ready queue.
    
		When a running thread has finished, it would exit and be the state of terminated.

Task#5
  
	Compare #4 and #5:
    
		Block level synchronization should theoretically be faster than method level synchronization.
    
		Because the former would only lock the code in the synchronized curly braces, but the latter would block the whole method.
